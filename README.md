A Python-based guessing game that challenges players to identify League of Legends champion abilities as either Passive, Q, W, E, or R. The project uses web scraping to gather champion ability data from external sources, converts the raw information into a JSON file for efficient access, and then presents it in a fun, interactive quiz format.
